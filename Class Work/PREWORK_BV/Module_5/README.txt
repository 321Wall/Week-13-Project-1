Part 2
The world is increasingly becoming digital and we are seeing new threats appearing at an alarming rate. Whether it is from attacks on power grids, 
halting production of food related items on an industrial plant level, to the theft of thousand of peoples information and even identities.
So much of the physical world is directly affected by the digital world to a level few people appear to comprehend and I myself would like to better 
comprehend the dangers that are present in the world and be able to actually do something about it. The digital world will continue to grow and 
evolve in ways I do not understand but I want to. I want to be able to understand and affect change in that world instead of just reading stories about 
how power outages around the globe are being caused by hackers and ransomware attacks. How hundreds of thousands of peoples private information can be stolen.
How businesses world wide can be heald hostage by ransomware attacks. I want to be a part of the solution.
